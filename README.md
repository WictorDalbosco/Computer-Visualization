# Computer Visualization

For this studies project we chose an dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows) that show us the top 1000 movies from all the time and we perfomed the data analysis and pre-processing, and a detailed, varied and relevant visualization for all the data, using histograms, heat maps, pair plots, bar plot, pie charts, box plot and wordclouds.

A [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/WictorDalbosco/Computer-Visualization/blob/main/computer_visualization.ipynb) can be found for faster visualization, or if you desire to run on a dashboard with streamlit, you can follow these steps:

You will need the files in this repository and some libraries:

- streamlit
- pandas
- matplotlib
- plotly.express
- wordcloud

They can be installed using:

```
pip install lib-name
```

Then after all the installation is done, you can run with

```
streamlit run trab2.py
```

The streamlit version presents full interation with the user, and you can change values with sliders and such.

A demonstration in portuguese can be found in this [link](https://youtu.be/hzybluWtt3s).
